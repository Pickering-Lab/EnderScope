### Hardware
All files licenced under the CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Permissive **_EXCEPT_** the [EnderScopeHotendToolHolder](Stls/EnderHotendToolHolder.stl), [EnderScopeToolHolder](Stls/EnderScopeToolHolder.stl), [Lever](Stls/Lever.stl), [ToolHolderBase](Stls/ToolHolderBase.stl) and [CableTidy](Stls/CableTidy.stl) which are licenced under CC-BY-SA 3.0 (see below).
     
      
      CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Permissive
      Preamble
      
      CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among
      hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the
      freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs
      and products based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open
      Hardware Licence comes in three variants: this licence, CERN-OHL-P
      (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W (weakly
      reciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).
      
      The CERN-OHL-P is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in
      unmodified form only.
      
      Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any
      Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in
      their development.
      
      
      1 Definitions
      
        1.1 'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-P.
      
        1.2 'Source' means information such as design materials or digital
            code which can be applied to Make or test a Product or to
            prepare a Product for use, Conveyance or sale, regardless of its
            medium or how it is expressed. It may include Notices.
      
        1.3 'Covered Source' means Source that is explicitly made available
            under this Licence.
      
        1.4 'Product' means any device, component, work or physical object,
            whether in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use,
            application or processing of Covered Source.
      
        1.5 'Make' means to create or configure something, whether by
            manufacture, assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered
            Source or another Product or otherwise.

            this Licence.
      
        1.8 'Licensor' means a person who creates Source or modifies Covered
            Source and subsequently Conveys the resulting Covered Source
            under the terms and conditions of this Licence. A person may be

            add additional Notices applicable to Your modifications.
      
        3.3 You may Convey modified Covered Source (with the effect that You
            shall also become a Licensor) provided that You:
      
             a) retain Notices as required in subsection 3.2; and
      
             b) add a Notice to the modified Covered Source stating that You
                have modified it, with the date and brief description of how
                You have modified it.
      
        3.4 You may Convey Covered Source or modified Covered Source under
            licence terms which differ from the terms of this Licence
            provided that You:
      
             a) comply at all times with subsection 3.3; and

      to the Product.
      
      
      5 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY
      
        5.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY -- The Covered Source and any Products
            are provided 'as is' and any express or implied warranties,
            including, but not limited to, implied warranties of
            merchantability, of satisfactory quality, non-infringement of
            third party rights, and fitness for a particular purpose or use
            are disclaimed in respect of any Source or Product to the
            maximum extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no
            representation that any Source or Product does not or will not
            infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other
            proprietary right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and
            performance of any Source or Product shall be with You and not
            the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part
            of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights
            granted under this Licence.
      
        5.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor shall, to
            the maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for
            direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary,
            punitive or other damages of any character including, without
            limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of
            use, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused
            and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including
            negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way
            in relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source
            and/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of
            the possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the
            Licensor(s) free and harmless from any liability, costs,
            damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties,
            in relation to such use.
      
      
      6 Patents
      
        6.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each
            Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
            non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
            stated in this section 6, or where terminated by the Licensor
            for cause) patent licence to Make, have Made, use, offer to
            sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Covered Source
            and Products, where such licence applies only to those patent
            claims licensable by such Licensor that are necessarily
            infringed by exercising rights under the Covered Source as
            Conveyed by that Licensor.
      
        6.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including
            a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
            Covered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory
            patent infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent
            licensed to You under this Licence is invalid or unenforceable
            then any rights granted to You under this Licence shall
            terminate as of the date such process is initiated.
      
      
      7 General
      
        7.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become
            invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining
            provisions shall remain effective.
      
        7.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and
            abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is
            known, except where needed to comply with section 3, or where
            the use is otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use
            shall be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind
            of endorsement or implication of involvement by the Licensor or
            its personnel.
      
        7.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence
            which it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may
            differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. New
            versions will be published with a unique version number and a
            variant identifier specifying the variant. If the Licensor has
            specified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source
            without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source
            as being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that
            variant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be
            treated as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may
            also specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific
            version of the CERN-OHL or any later version in which case You
            may apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL with the same
            variant identifier published by CERN.
      
        7.4 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor
            acting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are
            specifically excluded.

            Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
            
            3. License Grant.
            
            Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
            
            to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
            
            to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work.

            to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
            
            to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
            
            For the avoidance of doubt:
            
            Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
            
            Waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
            
            Voluntary License Schemes . The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
            
            The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.

            4. Restrictions.
            
            The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
            
            You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b) , as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b) , as requested.
            
            You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported) ("Applicable License"). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) , applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
            
            If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a) , keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b) , in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
            
            Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
            
            5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
            
            UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
            
            6. Limitation on Liability.
            
            EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
            
            7. Termination
            
            This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
            Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
            8. Miscellaneous
            
            Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
            Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
            If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
            No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
            This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
            The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

        By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
        
        Section 1 – Definitions.
        
        Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
        Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
        Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
        Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
        Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
        Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
        Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
        Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
        Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
        You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
        Section 2 – Scope.
        
        License grant.
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
        produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
        Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
        Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
        Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
        Downstream recipients.
        Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
        No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
        Other rights.
        
        Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
        Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
        To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
        Section 3 – License Conditions.
        
        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.
        
        Attribution.
        
        If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
        
        retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
        identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
        a copyright notice;
        a notice that refers to this Public License;
        a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
        a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
        indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
        indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
        You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
        If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
        If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.
        Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
        
        Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
        
        for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
        if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
        You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
        Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
        
        Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
        To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
        The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
        Section 6 – Term and Termination.
        
        This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
        Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
        
        automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
        upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
        For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
        Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
        Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
        
        The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
        Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        Section 8 – Interpretation.
        
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
        To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
        No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
        Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
